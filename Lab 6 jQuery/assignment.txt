Using jQuery:



1. Create 4 divs, each 100px by 100px (not tables)

2. Using jquery add css class to the above divs so that they are aligned to be next to each other in a row

3. Using jquery, assign style to these divs so that every other div is black (like the chess board).

4. Using jquery, set the innerHTML for all these to the value of their Id. Cell 1 should show 1 and so on.

5. Using jquery, append the 4 divs to the "main" div.

6. Attach a "click" event to the button "chgColor". When this button is clicked any div that has "black" background should change to "green"

7. Attach a "click" event to the button "chgText". When this button is clicked all divs should change the content from id to "div"+id

ie cell 1 should show Div1 instead of 1.
