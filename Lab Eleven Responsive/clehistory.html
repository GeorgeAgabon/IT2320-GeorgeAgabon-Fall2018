				<p>The <strong>City of Cleveland</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
					Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
					when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
					It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
					remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
					<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
					containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
					Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. Richard McClintock, 
					a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
					consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
					discovered the undoubtable source.</p>

                <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (
					The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, 
					very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
					comes from a line in section 1.10.32. </p>
